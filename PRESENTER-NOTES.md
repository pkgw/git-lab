# Presenter Notes

These are notes from when the tutorial is presented. I always come away from a
presentation with ideas for how to improve things next time, but I almost
never have the time to sit down and make those improvements when everything is
fresh in my mind. So, I jot down notes here.

## 2019-11-12: Center for Astrophysics

- Two-hour tutorial. The timing felt just about perfect. One hour for intro
  and Part 1, about 25 minutes each for Parts 2 and 3, and a bit of wrap-up.
- About 18 attendees, right-sized for just me to manage everything.
- Deployed the new landscape format handout with marginal notes. I like how it
  came out.
- Had a spiel about branches and DAGs, delivered between Parts 1 and 2, rather
  than lots of text in the handout. I think this worked better, but still feel
  super unsure as to whether the graph-theory stuff is at all helpful.
- Was happy with how new GitHub pull request bit worked out, and I like the
  way we accumulate "alumni" in the repo.
- Should have a list of prerequisites somewhere: Unix-like CLI, git, web
  browser, GitHub account, Python installation with Numpy, a laptop, a code
  editor, extremely basic familiarity with Python. As ever, something to
  ponder is how to get the fiddly bits set up ahead of time (e.g., getting git
  to launch the right editor).
- Play music or something? I don't like how it gets all silent while people
  are typing away, even though of course that means that they're
  concentrating.
- Live-presentation materials should have emphasized more the freedom enabled
  by being able to give up on experiments safely.
- Quickly mentioned CI and other GitHub value-adds at the end. I feel like that
  was an OK balance of time, but could have spent more time on that. CI, code
  review ... what else would be important to emphasize?
- In 2 attempts thus far, asking people to turn to their neighbors and
  introduce themselves is *very* effective for getting a nice hubbub in the
  room at the beginning of the session.
- Idea: "gold stars" (stickers, WWT bookmarks, whatever) for good questions
- Idea: *command* people to tell things to their neighbors at various stages
  of the tutorial to raise the mean chatter level.
- Several more advanced people were confused by the magic commit ID when
  creating the `print-my-name` branch. Just use origin/master? I forget why
  exactly I went this route.
- Should add some scripts to auto-download the necessary font files and
  potentially other large-or-non-redistributable assets.
- My slides weren't filling up the browser window. Something weird in the
  reveal.js files here? The files are pretty old.
