- venue updated on title slide
- date updated on title slide
- title synched in <title>, title slide, title-and-abstract.txt
- check out margins with hacked CSS -- then un-hack CSS!
- PDF version created:

  google-chrome --allow-file-access-from-files slides.html
  change URL to .../slides.html?print-pdf#/
  print, save as export.pdf *in correct directory*

- phone silent
- pockets emptied
- popup blocker disabled

NOTE: background looks funky in Chrome but prints to PDF correctly. Title page
footer CSS needed some futzing to work out OK.
