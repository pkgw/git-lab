# A Laboratory Introduction to git and GitHub

This repository contains resources for a lab-style [git] tutorial. By
“lab-style,” I mean that most of the time in supposed to be spent with the
learners quasi-independently working their way through a set of tasks in small
groups, with “lab assistants” available to answer questions as they come up.
In my experience, this is the best way to teach something like [git] in a
group, since people move at such different paces.

The tasks are described in a thorough “lab manual” handout. A
[pre-built PDF][handoutpdf], likely corresponding to `main` here, is
available online.

This tutorial is aimed at scientists. It brings up some mathematical concepts
but tries not to assume much in the way of programming skills.

## Contents

* `slides/` contains some HTML slides used during the tutorial. They have no
  speaker notes and probably won't be super helpful for anyone other than the
  original author. They use [reveal.js] and the template might be of interest;
  see my [htmltalk] repository and accompanying [blog post][slideblog].
* `handout/` contains LaTeX source for the printed lab manual. It uses
  [Tectonic] and a few nonstandard fonts and packages, so it might take a few
  tries to compile.
* [PRESENTER-NOTES.md](./PRESENTER-NOTES.md) logs notes from times when I’ve
  presented the tutorial, to serve as reminders for the next time I revise the
  materials in preparation for another presentation.
