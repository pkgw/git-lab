# A Laboratory Introduction to git

This repository contains resources for a lab-style git tutorial. By
“lab-style,” I mean that most of the time in supposed to be spent with the
learners quasi-independently working their way through a set of tasks in small
groups, with “lab assistants” available to answer questions as they come up.
In my experience, this is the best way to teach something like `git` in a
group, since people move at such different paces.

This tutorial is aimed at scientists. It brings up some mathematical concepts
but tries not to assume much in the way of programming skills.


## Contents

* `slides` contains some HTML slides for a *very* brief introduction to
  `git`. They have no notes and probably won't be super helpful for anyone
  other than the original author.
* `handout` contains `LaTeX` source for the printed lab manual.
